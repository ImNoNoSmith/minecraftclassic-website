The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) is a national laboratory
operated by Stanford University for the US Department of Energy.
SLAC has been in continuous use for over 25 years in a national research
program that has made major contributions to our understanding of
nature.  The Center is one of a handful of laboratories worldwide that
stands at the forefront of research into the basic
constituents of matter and the forces that act between them.
<p>
SLAC does experimental and theoretical research
in elementary particle physics using electron beams, plus a broad program
of research in atomic and solid state physics, chemistry, biology and
medicine using synchrotron radiation.  Scientists from all parts of the
United States and throughout the world participate in this work.
There are active programs in the development of accelerators
and detectors for high energy physics research and of new sources and
instrumentation for synchrotron radiation research.
<p>
SLAC was founded in 1962, and the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) came into being in 1979 as a national
users' facility.
SSRL became part of the SLAC facility in 1992.  Their
combined staff is currently about 1400, of whom 150 are Ph.D. physicists.
At any given time, there are
typically 300-400 physicists from other institutions participating
in the high energy physics program and 600 scientists in the
synchrotron radiation program.
<p>
SLAC has the following major facilities:
<ul>
<li><b>The Linac</b>, a three-kilometer (or two-mile)
long linear accelerator, capable of producing electron and positron
beams with energies up to 50 GeV
<li><b>SPEAR</b>, a storage ring 80 meters in diameter now
used as a synchrotron radiation source
<li><b>PEP</b>, a 30 GeV colliding-beam storage ring, 800 meters in
diameter
<li><b>SLC</b>, a 100 GeV electron-positron linear collider
<li>Several large particle-detection facilities
</ul>

A number of significant
<a href="https://swap.stanford.edu/was/19931201000000mp_/http://www.slac.stanford.edu/winters/pub/www/key-events.ps">events</a>
have been associated with these facilities
and the physics done using them.
<p>
Located on 426 acres of Stanford University property, the
<a href="slacfac.html">laboratory</a>
is three miles west of the main campus.
Its main entrance is on Sand Hill Road, just east of Interstate 280.

Linear Accelerator Center" (May, 1993) from the Public Affairs Office.
